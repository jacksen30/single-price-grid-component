# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component solution

This is my personal solution to the [Single price grid component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc). 

## Heres are a few features of my website / component

* The HTML uses semantic tags where possible.
* Mobile first design as to be inline with Googles mobile first indexing best practices in relation to SEO.
* The page is made responsive, by using a CSS GRID layout, currently has 2 breakpoints but more could be added in the future.
* Rems used as the prefered unit of measure. 
* CSS variables added for colors that are re-used on multiple elements, this way the color scheme can be changed easily.
